ORIGINAL EXPLANATION:
The December 28 night launch of a Falcon Heavy rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Florida marked the fifth launch for the rocket's reusable side boosters. About 2 minutes 20 seconds into the flight, the two side boosters separated from the rocket's core stage. Starting just after booster separation, this three minute long exposure captures the pair's remarkable boostback burns, maneuvers executed prior to their return to landing zones on planet Earth. While no attempt was made to recover the Falcon Heavy's core stage, both side boosters landed successfully and can be flown again. The four previous flights for these side boosters included last October's launch of NASA's asteroid-bound Psyche mission. Their next planned flight is on the Europa Clipper mission scheduled for launch in October 2024.

SIMPLIFIED VERSION:
Imagine you're watching a powerful rocket blast off into space. As it reaches a certain height, two boosters - like super-strong wings - detach from the main rocket. Instead of falling to the ground, they make a U-turn in mid-air, using their own engines to slow down and come back to Earth. This is called a "boostback burn." It's like a rocket-powered parachute, allowing them to land safely in specific zones and be reused for future missions. This technology helps reduce waste and saves time by reusing boosters instead of making new ones.
